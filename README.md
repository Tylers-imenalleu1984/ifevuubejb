OMG, just finished watching Last Bullet and I honestly don't even know where to start. It's like, mind blown! ðŸ¤¯ And I gotta say, my brain feels like scrambled eggs right now. You ever get that feeling after a super intense movie? Like, it's still playing in my head and I'm just sitting here, kinda dazed. ðŸ˜‚

So, first off, I loved how unpredictable it was! I mean, you think one thing is gonna happen, and BAM, the movie just hits you with another twist outta nowhere. I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time. And I swear, if anyone had walked in, they would've thought I was tripping or something. But seriously though, that ending? WHAT. Was NOT expecting that.

> Also, did you catch that scene with the train? Like, I was gripping the couch so hard, I think I left indentations. ðŸ™ˆ

It's like whoever wrote this was on some next-level adrenaline rush. Anyway, remember when we were planning to download the movie but couldn't find a good link? Just glad we finally got to watch the movie. Totally worth the hassle. I'm telling you though, the soundtrack was pure fire, totally going on my playlist, no question!

And donâ€™t even get me started on the acting. Like, why is everybody in this film so damn talented? Itâ€™s almost unfair. Makes me wanna sign up for acting classes, even though I can barely read a script without laughing in the middle. You know what I mean?

if (thoughts == everywhere) Console.WriteLine(Same here!);

Yo, I need some caffeine or something, maybe even go for a walk and clear my head a bit. Anyway, hit me up when you're free, and let's chat more about it. I'm sure there's a ton we missed on the first watch. Talk soon! ðŸ˜„
